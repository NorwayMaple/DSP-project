Next steps:

YOu have streamlines the testing of chorus function by separating chorus.py into three separate files, and upon testing it, you have found you need to adjust the frame rate for different .wav files as they are read.  So you have just rewriten the read and writeing of .wavs to be part of a WaveData class.  You must update chorus.py to reflect the objectification, and then test it again

 Test chorus on prerecorded sounds, first sustained waveforms like a guitar, then changing ones such as speech - maybe use matplotlib and/or scipy fft to troubleshoot

 Change LFO parameters and algorithm as necessarys
